## Alien Invasion

This is a simple simulation project where you control the movements of aliens who have visited Earth. The aliens move across the map and, when they reach the edge, they bounce back in the opposite direction.

Aliens move in a "bounce" map, bouncing back when they reach the edges of the map. The aliens' movements can be controlled by the user's decisions.

When two or more aliens meet at the same rectangle, they are presented as a group.

When they get to the edge, they reflect the direction for their current move.
